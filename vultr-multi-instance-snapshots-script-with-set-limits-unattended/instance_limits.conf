# Set your instance limits here. Where instance_id_1, instance_id_2, and instance_id_3 are placeholder values that should be manually entered by the user. These need to be replaced with actual Vultr instance IDs before running the script. The script does not automatically populate or replace these values. Users need to know their Vultr instance IDs and manually configure the limits for each instance they want to set a custom limit for in the configuration file. The numbers after the colon (5, 3, 4) represent the individual snapshot limits for each respective instance. This configuration allows setting custom snapshot limits for specific instances, providing flexibility in managing snapshots across different servers.
